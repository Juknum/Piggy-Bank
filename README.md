### Welcome to the piggy-bank project (SY43)

## App purpose

The main purpose of this app is saving money with the "Budget du zero" method.
This is simple : You can define your budget in the "Saving Goals" section, and your expenses in the "Spending" section.
The aim is to reach 0 on the available balance at the end of the month.

## Name choice

"Piggy Bank" is a small container, sometimes in the shape of a pig, that is used by children for saving money. That's the reason why we have chosen this name, and the picture of the app related to it.
